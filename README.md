# A10
Chapter 4 Town Hall 
<p> A10 is giving me issues since it uses the same files from A08</p>
<p> Everything I'm doing also uploads A08 to the same repository. </p>
<p> To circumvent this problem, I'm using a direct upload again.</p>
<p> If I redownload webstorm,  I should probably be able to work without this connection problem? I don't think I can upload every single homework assignment like this. (It doesn't feel right.)</p>
